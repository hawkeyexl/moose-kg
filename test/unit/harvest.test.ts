/**
 * Near-miss detection for the harvest rule's page-level inputs (ADR 01028).
 *
 * The ladder is both halves: the misspellings that must warn, and the ordinary
 * page keys that must stay silent. A near-miss check that fires on `title` or
 * `draft` would be worse than none — it would train readers to ignore it.
