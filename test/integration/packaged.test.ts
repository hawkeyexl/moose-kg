/**
 * The package as a consumer receives it.
 *
 * Every other test runs the CLI out of the working tree, where everything
 * resolves because everything is there. That cannot see the class of defect
 * that only exists in the published artifact: a path missing from `files`, a
 * `bin` pointing at something that was never built, an `exports` map that works
 * in the repo and nowhere else, or a bundled schema the code reaches by a path
 * that does not survive packing.
 *
 * So this packs the tarball with `npm pack` and runs the CLI out of the
 * extracted bytes. Extraction goes under `.tmp/` inside the repo on purpose:
 * Node then resolves runtime dependencies by walking up to the repo's own
 * `node_modules`, which keeps the test hermetic — no registry, no network — while
 * still exercising exactly the files that would ship (ADR 01026).
