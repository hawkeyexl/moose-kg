# Adopt docmeta's common `kg` vocabulary instead of self-hosting a frontmatter schema

## Context and Problem Statement

dockg has published its own frontmatter contract since 0.1: eight immutable JSON Schemas under
[`schemas/`](../schemas), evolved by adding a version file. [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) recorded the
rule that made that work — *schemas and shapes are self-hosted; never add dockg schemas to
docmeta's built-in registry*.

docmeta has now reversed the premise that rule rested on. Proposal 0023 (*the docmeta metadata
vocabularies*) publishes nine common vocabularies and draws a new dividing line:

> docmeta publishes common metadata vocabularies; tools implement behavior — graders, graphs,
> runtimes — against them.

One of the nine, `docmeta:kg:1.0.0-proposal.1`, **is dockg's `frontmatter-0.8`**, reworked. The
proposal was designed by walking dockg's draft contract alongside docevals' and moose-tracevals',
and it carries an explicit dockg-side ledger: adopt the kebab spellings, apply a page-level harvest
fallback, derive the topic type, normalize the single-string shorthand, and supersede the
never-a-docmeta-built-in rule. The proof that it is the same contract is that the proposal's own
`kg` example ladder case 9 is a line-for-line translation of
[`test/fixtures/corpus/docs/configuration.md`](../test/fixtures/corpus/docs/configuration.md).

Two things make this urgent rather than optional. The vocabulary is *common*: a grader, a graph
builder, and a retrieval tool reading the same `kg` block is the whole point, and dockg holding a
private dialect defeats it. And the window is cheap — the same reversal is free for docevals and
moose-tracevals because neither has shipped.

So: where does dockg's frontmatter contract come from now, and what happens to documents written
against 0.8?

## Decision Drivers

- A common vocabulary only pays off if the implementations agree byte for byte. A near-copy is worse
  than no copy, because it looks compatible.
- Proposal 0023 is **under review and explicitly unregistered**: "Do not register, sync, or default
  any of these ids before the review concludes." dockg cannot resolve `docmeta:kg:1.0.0-proposal.1`
  from docmeta's registry, because it is not in it.
- dockg's published schemas are immutable. Whatever lands must not edit `frontmatter-0.8.json`.
- Determinism is the product contract. A rename must not move a single triple that is not genuinely
  about the renamed fact.
- docmeta's own house rule: *do not add a deprecated alias to soften a rename*, because an alias is
  a permanent second surface.

## Considered Options

1. **Stay self-hosted.** Keep `frontmatter-0.9` with dockg's own spellings.
2. **Vendor docmeta's draft bytes now**, pending registration, and hard-break the camelCase names.
3. **Vendor, but dual-read camelCase** through a deprecation window.
4. **Wait for docmeta to register `docmeta:kg:1.0.0`** before changing anything.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **option 2** — ship
[`schemas/docmeta-kg-1.0.0-proposal.1.json`](../schemas/docmeta-kg-1.0.0-proposal.1.json) as a
**byte-verbatim copy** of docmeta's draft, `$id` included, and read only the new kebab spellings.

The file is named for its origin, not `frontmatter-1.0`, because it is not dockg's schema: the
bytes are docmeta's and the `$id` says so. `bundledSchemaPath` points at it;
`frontmatter-0.1`–`0.8` stay on disk untouched, because published schemas are immutable and someone
may still pin one.

**Verbatim is the load-bearing word.** Rewriting the `$id` to a `dockg.dev` URL would have made the
copy dockg's own contract again under a borrowed name — the exact failure this decision exists to
avoid — and it would have cost the one cheap integrity check available: a sha256 of the file against
the upstream revision, asserted in `test/unit/kg-vocabulary.test.ts`. A hash, not a path comparison,
because docmeta is an npm dependency in CI and not a working tree.

Option 4 was rejected on sequencing, not principle. The review it waits on is the one this adoption
is evidence for; blocking until registration would leave dockg unable to demonstrate that the
vocabulary works in the implementation it was derived from.

Option 3 — dual-reading camelCase — was rejected for docmeta's reason and one of dockg's own. The
reason is not that breakage is free: this is a `feat!:`, and it costs the major version and a
release note. It is that an alias is a permanent second surface, and here it would be a second
surface on the very contract whose point is that everyone reads one. dockg's own reason is
narrower and sharper: `dockg validate` would reject a camelCase document that `dockg build`
happily derived from, and two commands disagreeing about what the frontmatter says is a worse
failure than a loud rename.

For the same reason, the deriver stops accepting the deprecated single-object `kg.provenance`
shape and the `kg.generatedBy` key: both are rejected by the vendored schema, so deriving from
them would reintroduce exactly that disagreement.

### The version scheme this brings with it

The nine vocabularies carry **three-segment** semver where dockg's own artifacts carry two. That is
not cosmetic. Published bytes are immutable, so the only lawful way to fix a typo in a field
`description` is to publish a new version — and with two segments the only available move is `0.9`,
which announces new fields when none were added. Three segments let a documentation fix be a PATCH
and say so:

| Segment | Means |
|---|---|
| MAJOR | a document that used to validate now fails |
| MINOR | a document that used to fail may now pass; every old one still validates |
| PATCH | no validation-behavior change at all |

dockg adopts this for its own published artifacts going forward. The existing
`frontmatter-0.N.json` and `dockg-0.N.ttl` files are published and stay as they are; the convention
binds the next version file of each, which will be three-segment.

### Consequences

- **Every 0.8 document must be migrated.** The `kg` block is closed, so `prefLabel`, `subjects`,
  `topicType`, `appliesTo`, `softwareSubject` and the rest now fail `dockg validate` loudly rather
  than being silently ignored. This is a breaking change and the release note must say so.
- **`dockg.config.yaml` breaks too, and the release note must say that separately** — it is easy
  to read this decision as frontmatter-only and migrate just the docs. Two config surfaces name
  the same vocabulary and were renamed with it:
  - `fill.fields` — its enum is the twelve fillable field names, so `fields: [prefLabel]` now
    fails Ajv with `/fill/fields/0: must be equal to one of the allowed values` (exit 2).
  - `stats.coverageThreshold` — the per-field map is `additionalProperties: false` over the
    measured field names, so `coverageThreshold: { prefLabel: 80 }` fails the same way.

  Both rejections are the intended loud failure, and `test/unit/config.test.ts` pins them so the
  enums cannot quietly widen back.
- **`dockg fill` refuses a document whose `kg.provenance` is the deprecated single-object shape**
  rather than overwriting it. `provenance` is written wholesale on every fill, and the legacy
  shape is deliberately unreadable, so proceeding would silently delete another model's
  outstanding review record — the one thing the provenance trail exists to prevent. It is a
  per-doc error (the run continues, exit 1), and the message names the migration.
  Proposal 0023's summary claims "every 0.8-valid document stays valid"; that holds for the
  *widening* only, and its own ladder pins N2 and N8 — both 0.8-valid — as expected rejects.
- **The emitted graph does not move.** Only frontmatter *keys* changed; the RDF mapping always
  lived in field descriptions. `iirds:has-topic-type`, `dockg:notApplicableToVariant` and every
  other predicate keep their names, so a consumer's SPARQL keeps working. Migrating the corpus
  fixture produced a **byte-identical golden** — the fidelity proof, and the same role
  proposal 0023's translated ladder case plays.
- Two places do surface a field name as data, and they change: the `dockg:filledField` literal and
  the `#prov.kg-fill.<model>.field.<name>` IRI.
- The `kg` block gains the single-string shorthand and loses the empty-list hole (`minItems: 1`
  everywhere), so `applies-to: []` — which used to read as "scoped, to nothing" — is now a
  rejection.
- **dockg now tracks an upstream draft.** When docmeta publishes a new revision of the proposal,
  the sha256 pin fails, which is the intended signal. When the id is finally registered, the
  vendored copy should be reconsidered — that is a follow-up this ADR does not decide.
- The published SHACL shapes are **unchanged**. Their shape-node local names still read
  `dsh:Document-topicType`, but `sh:path` values are the predicates, and those did not move.
  The cosmetic drift is corrected at the next genuine shapes version.
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)'s "schemas and shapes are self-hosted" invariant is superseded in its
  schema half. Shapes remain self-hosted; the frontmatter schema is vendored.
- The field *naming* recorded in ADRs [01012](01012-iirds-core-vocabulary.md),
  [01013](01013-section-level-metadata.md), [01014](01014-negative-scope.md) and
  [01015](01015-fill-confidence.md) is superseded here. Those ADRs remain authoritative for their
  decisions — the iiRDS vocabulary, section-level typing, negative scope, and the confidence
  trail all survive intact under new spellings.

### Confirmation

- `test/unit/kg-vocabulary.test.ts` ports **all 21 cases** of docmeta's own `kg` ladder (9 positive,
  12 negative) and runs them against the vendored file, plus the sha256 pin and an `$id` assertion.
  Each negative names the key its error must point at, so a case cannot pass for the wrong reason.
- The golden determinism gate is byte-identical across the migration, and `dockg check` stays at
  0 violations on the clean corpus — the evidence that no shapes bump is owed.
- `test/unit/schema-sync.test.ts` now proves the property it always existed for: a `kg` block
  shaped the way `fill` proposes is *validated* against the schema, rather than compared on a
  declared `type` string.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. Stay self-hosted

- Good, because nothing breaks and no upstream draft is tracked.
- Bad, because it forfeits the only thing a common vocabulary buys — a grader, a graph, and a
  retrieval tool reading one block — while keeping all the cost of maintaining a schema.

### 2. Vendor verbatim, hard break

- Good, because the bytes are provably upstream's, checkable with one hash.
- Good, because `validate` and `build` cannot disagree about what frontmatter means.
- Bad, because every existing corpus needs a migration pass, with no codemod shipped.

### 3. Vendor with a camelCase dual-read

- Good, because existing corpora keep building untouched.
- Bad, because the two commands disagree: `build` would derive from documents `validate` rejects.
- Bad, because the alias never goes away in practice, and it is a second surface on the one
  contract whose value is that there is only one.

### 4. Wait for registration

- Good, because it avoids carrying a copy at all.
- Bad, because the review it waits for is the one this work is evidence for.
