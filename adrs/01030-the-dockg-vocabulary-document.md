# A vocabulary document for `dockg:`, at an IRI that resolves

## Context and Problem Statement

dockg mints 17 terms — 2 classes, 12 properties, 3 role individuals — under
`https://dockg.dev/ns#`. Nothing in the repository defined any of them. The SHACL shapes
*constrain* the terms; no file said what one means, and the namespace IRI resolved to nothing at
all.

For a project whose pitch is standards-typed output consumed by the outside world, that was the one
place it did not hold itself to the standard it sells. A consumer who receives a graph, hits
`dockg:brokenLink`, and does what linked data says to do — dereference the IRI — got nothing.

## Decision Drivers

- The custom namespace is deliberately small, and every term in it exists because no published
  vocabulary had one. Those are exactly the terms a consumer cannot look up elsewhere.
- Published schemas and shapes are immutable and versioned by adding a file. A vocabulary is the
  same kind of artifact and should follow the same rule.
- [ADR 01014](01014-negative-scope.md) refuses inference dockg did not assert. A definition document
  must not smuggle it back in.
- A vocabulary rots the moment a phase mints a predicate and forgets the document. Whatever ships
  needs a guard, not a convention.

## Considered Options

For the document:
1. **RDFS**, with non-entailing domain and range.
2. **OWL**, with domains, ranges, and disjointness axioms.
3. **A prose reference page only** — human-readable, not machine-readable.

For the namespace:
4. **Move it to the docs origin now** — `https://hawkeyexl.github.io/dockg/ns#`.
5. **Acquire `dockg.dev`** and serve it there.
6. **Ship the file, leave the IRI unresolvable.**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **option 1 for the document, option 4 for the namespace.**

### RDFS, not OWL

dockg emits nothing that depends on reasoning. OWL axioms would duplicate the SHACL shapes — which
already own every constraint — while inviting reasoners to infer what ADR 01014 exists to refuse.
The split to hold, and the one the document states in its own header:

> **RDFS defines what a term means; SHACL says what a valid graph looks like.**

For the same reason, domain and range use `schema:domainIncludes` and `schema:rangeIncludes` rather
than `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range`. Those RDFS terms are *entailment rules*: asserting
`rdfs:domain dockg:Document` licenses a reasoner to type any subject carrying the property as a
Document, which is a claim dockg never made. schema.org's pair documents the same intent and
entails nothing. A test asserts the RDFS forms appear zero times.

Each term carries `rdfs:label`, an `rdfs:comment` that says what it means **and what it does not**,
`rdfs:isDefinedBy` pointing home, and `skos:example` where the shape is non-obvious. The comments
carry the distinctions that matter: `dockg:brokenLink` is a finding about this corpus, not a claim
that the target does not exist; `dockg:confidence` is a model's estimate of its own reliability, not
a measurement.

### The namespace moves, and it is breaking

`dockg.dev` does not resolve and is not ours. Pre-release breaking changes are explicitly fine, and
this one is free now and expensive later: every IRI in every graph anyone has built would have to
change. So the namespace becomes `https://hawkeyexl.github.io/dockg/ns#`, served by the
documentation site that already exists.

Being a **hash namespace** is what makes this cheap: strip the fragment and one document serves
every term. GitHub Pages cannot content-negotiate, so the practical floor is a page at `/dockg/ns/`
carrying the terms, with `<link rel="alternate" type="text/turtle">` to `/dockg/ns.ttl`.

Two IRI families move together — the terms and the shapes namespace (`dsh:`) — which means a new
`shapes/dockg-0.6.ttl`, since published shapes are immutable. **0.6 changes no constraint.** The
`schemas/frontmatter-0.*.json` `$id`s stay as they are: they are published, superseded by
`docmeta:kg`, and rewriting a published id would be worse than leaving it.

### Consequences

- **Breaking.** Every `dockg:` IRI in every emitted graph changes. Two goldens regenerate —
  `graph.ttl` and `graph.jsonld`, the only two carrying the namespace — and the diff is the
  namespace lines and nothing else, which is the evidence that nothing else moved.
- `check`'s bundled default becomes `shapes/dockg-0.6.ttl`.
- `ns/` ships in the npm package beside `schemas/` and `shapes/`, so an offline consumer can load
  the vocabulary by path.
- The site gains a page at `/dockg/ns/` that is deliberately **not** in the sidebar: a reader
  arrives there by dereferencing an IRI, not by browsing. Its address is decided by the namespace,
  not by the navigation — the one page on the site where that is true.
- `scripts/check-docs-links.mjs` learned that a link may target a published *file* rather than a
  page. It previously resolved only `<route>/index.html`, so `/dockg/ns.ttl` read as broken.

### Confirmation

`test/unit/vocabulary.test.ts` — the drift guard runs in **both** directions, reading the emitter's
side out of `src/` rather than from a hand-kept list, because a hand-kept list is the thing that
drifts:

- every term the emitter can produce is defined here;
- **nothing is defined that the emitter cannot produce** — a definition for a term that does not
  exist misleads exactly as much as a term with no definition;
- every term has a label, a comment, and an `rdfs:isDefinedBy`;
- the ontology header carries title, license, `owl:versionInfo`, `owl:versionIRI`, and the VANN
  prefix declarations, so a consumer that fetches the document learns the prefix the emitter writes
  rather than guessing it;
- `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` appear zero times.

The link checker's new asset branch was verified in both directions: `/dockg/ns.ttl` resolves, and
a link to `/dockg/nope.ttl` is still reported unresolved.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. RDFS with non-entailing domain/range

- Good, because it says what terms mean without asserting anything a reasoner can act on.
- Good, because it leaves constraints where they already live, in SHACL.
- Bad, because `schema:domainIncludes` is a schema.org convention rather than a W3C
  recommendation; a consumer expecting `rdfs:domain` finds nothing.

### 2. OWL

- Good, because it is the more standard choice for a vocabulary, and tooling expects it.
- Bad, because it duplicates the shapes and invites the inference this project spent an ADR
  refusing. A graph that says "absent means unknown" should not ship axioms that let a reasoner
  conclude otherwise.

### 3. Prose page only

- Good, because it costs least and readers get the same explanation.
- Bad, because dereferencing an IRI is what a linked-data consumer does, and it would still get
  nothing machine-readable.

### 4. Move to the docs origin

- Good, because it resolves today, at no cost, on infrastructure that already exists.
- Bad, because the namespace is now tied to a GitHub Pages URL. Moving again later means another
  breaking change — cheap now, expensive after release.

### 5. Acquire `dockg.dev`

- Good, because it is the more permanent home and reads better.
- Bad, because it makes correctness wait on a purchase, and nothing about the vocabulary needs it.
  Worth revisiting before 1.0, when the move is still affordable.

### 6. Ship the file, leave the IRI dead

- Good, because it defines the terms with no breaking change at all.
- Bad, because the whole complaint was that the IRI resolves to nothing. Shipping a definition
  nobody can reach from the graph solves the smaller half of the problem.
