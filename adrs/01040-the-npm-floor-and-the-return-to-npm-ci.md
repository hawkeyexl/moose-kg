# The npm floor, and the return to `npm ci`

## Context and Problem Statement

This repo banned `npm ci` for a while. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the CI comments both gave the same
reason. The committed lock was said to be generated on Windows, and to omit the Linux-side
optional dependencies of rolldown's wasm binding. A strict lock check could not pass on both
platforms.

That was a misdiagnosis, twice over. The lock records all fourteen `@rolldown/binding-*`
packages, every Linux one included, each with its `os`, `cpu`, `resolved` and `integrity`.
Nothing platform-specific is missing. And rolldown no longer ships a `wasm32-wasi` binding at
all, so `@emnapi/core` and `@emnapi/runtime` are not reachable in this tree and cannot have been
dropped from it.

The real variable was **npm's own version**, not the contributor's operating system. npm 11.6.2
and older drop the top-level entries for optional platform packages when they write a lockfile.
That happens on Linux, macOS and Windows alike, and 11.6.3 keeps them everywhere. docmeta reached
the same finding independently, through the identical dependency path.

So the ban was working around a real failure with the wrong cause named. `npm ci` was rejecting a
lockfile that a too-old npm had written, and the fix belonged at the npm version rather than at
the install command.

There is a second problem, and it is what makes this a decision rather than a bug report. The
Node floor does not imply the npm floor. Node 24.11.0 satisfies `engines.node` `>=24` and bundles
npm **11.6.1**, below the floor. A contributor on a fully compliant Node can regenerate a broken
lockfile and turn CI red with nothing naming the cause.

## Decision Drivers

- The lockfile should be authoritative. An install that is free to resolve around it makes CI a
  weaker check than it looks.
- A constraint that matters has to be enforced, not documented. `CONTRIBUTING.md` asked for npm
  11.6.3 and nothing checked.
- The failure has to name itself. A lockfile silently missing entries surfaces later, somewhere
  else, as a red build with no pointer back.
- Two floors that are not in step are a trap, so the weaker one must not be allowed to imply the
  stronger.

## Considered Options

1. **Restore `npm ci`, and enforce the npm floor through `engines.npm` plus `engine-strict`.**
2. **Restore `npm ci`, and document the npm floor without enforcing it.**
3. **Keep the ban on `npm ci`, and go on installing loosely everywhere.**
4. **Pin an exact npm version** rather than a floor.

## Decision Outcome

**Option 1 was chosen.** `engines.npm` is `>=11.6.3`, [.npmrc](../.npmrc) sets
`engine-strict=true`, and every CI job runs `npm ci`.

`engine-strict` is what turns the declaration into a gate. Without it npm treats `engines` as
advisory and installs anyway, which is the same as option 2. With it, a too-old npm fails at
install with `EBADENGINE` rather than quietly writing a lockfile CI will reject later.

The runners get the floor pinned explicitly, with `npm install -g npm@^11.6.3` before the
install step, because a runner image's bundled npm is not something this repo controls.

Option 4 was rejected because the failure has a floor and not a version. Pinning exactly would
mean a maintenance task every npm release, to no benefit.

### What this changes about ADR 01007

[ADR 01007](01007-quality-gate-enforcement.md) introduced `engine-strict=true`, and recorded a
consequence that no longer holds:

> Bad. `engine-strict` applies to dependencies too, so a transitive package declaring an engines
> range that excludes Node 24 will hard-fail `npm install`. Since CI and release both use
> `npm install` rather than `npm ci`, that can appear without any change to this repo.

The first sentence stands. The second does not, because CI and release both use `npm ci` now. The
exposure is smaller than 01007 described: a lockfile install resolves nothing, so a transitive
package cannot arrive without a lockfile change, which is reviewable. That bullet is struck
through in place there rather than deleted, matching how
[ADR 01020](01020-local-embeddings.md) handles the same situation. Every other part of 01007
stands.

### Consequences

- Good. The lockfile is authoritative in CI, so what CI installs is what the lock says.
- Good. A contributor below the floor is told at install time, by name, instead of through a red
  build somewhere downstream.
- Good. The trap is closed. Satisfying `engines.node` no longer implies satisfying `engines.npm`,
  and the tooling says so rather than the documentation alone.
- Bad. A contributor on Node 24.11.0 out of the box cannot install until they upgrade npm. That
  is the intended behavior, and the error names the fix.
- Bad. `engine-strict` still applies to dependencies, so a transitive package declaring a range
  that excludes Node 24 hard-fails the install. Reaching this now requires a lockfile change.
- Neutral. `docs/package-lock.json` stays on `npm install`, because that lock has not been
  verified against a strict install the way the root one was. See
  [docs.yml](../.github/workflows/docs.yml).

### Confirmation

- An unsatisfiable floor fails with `EBADENGINE` at install time, and `>=11.6.3` installs clean
  on npm 11.19.0. Both were checked when the floor landed.
- Six jobs install the root project, and all six run `npm ci`. Three are in
  [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml), namely `build-test`, `embed-real` and `fill-live`. The
  others are `inline-tests` in [doc-detective.yml](../.github/workflows/doc-detective.yml),
  `validate` in [docs.yml](../.github/workflows/docs.yml), and `release` in
  [release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml).
- CI's Node 24.19.0 bundles npm 11.17.0, above the floor, and each job pins the floor anyway.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. Restore `npm ci`, and enforce the floor (chosen)

- Good. The lock is authoritative, and the constraint that makes it work is checked.
- Good. The failure names itself, at the moment it is caused.
- Bad. Blocks an install on an otherwise compliant Node, until npm is upgraded.

### 2. Restore `npm ci`, document the floor only

- Good. No install ever fails on an engines check.
- Bad. This is the state that produced the problem. `CONTRIBUTING.md` asked for the floor and
  nothing enforced it, so a broken lockfile was one `npm install` away.

### 3. Keep the ban on `npm ci`

- Good. Nothing to change.
- Bad. Keeps a workaround whose stated cause is false, so nobody can reason about when it stops
  being needed.
- Bad. A loose install can resolve around the lockfile, which makes CI weaker than it reads.

### 4. Pin an exact npm version

- Good. Fully determined, with no range to reason about.
- Bad. The constraint is a floor. Pinning adds a recurring bump for no gain.
