# Explicit negative scope: mint `moose-kg:` non-applicability predicates

## Context and Problem Statement

The iiRDS research's central safety mechanism is the **interlock**: a
graph-governed assistant must be able to *refuse* — "this content does NOT apply
to variant X" — rather than helpfully guess across a boundary. moose-kg's positive
applicability ([ADR 01012](adrs/01012-iirds-core-vocabulary.md)) lets a document
or section say what it *does* apply to (`iirds:relates-to-product-variant`) and
what it *is about* (`iirds:has-subject`). But RDF is **open-world**: the absence
of a positive edge means "unknown," not "does not apply." So absence alone
cannot drive an interlock — a consumer cannot distinguish "this doc is silent
about variant X" from "this doc explicitly excludes variant X."

How should moose-kg let content assert **explicit non-applicability**, so a
retrieval layer can implement disciplined silence without inferring from missing
data?

## Decision Drivers

- Determinism and the **no-blank-nodes** invariant are absolute.
- SHACL is moose-kg's validation contract; the solution must be SHACL-validatable
  as ordinary triples.
- Prefer a standard term over minting into the minimal `moose-kg:` namespace.
- The negation must be a plain, queryable edge a naive consumer can read — the
  whole point is that a retrieval interlock can act on it.

## Considered Options

1. **Mint minimal `moose-kg:` predicates** — one negating variants, one negating
   subjects; plain `<subject> <predicate> <object>` triples.
2. **`owl:NegativePropertyAssertion`** — the OWL-standard idiom for "X does not
   have relation R to Y."
3. **Reuse a standard vocabulary term** (iiRDS / schema.org).
4. **Documentation-only guidance** — tell consumers to treat some external
   convention as negative scope; emit nothing.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option 1: **mint two minimal `moose-kg:` predicates**,
`moose-kg:notApplicableToVariant` and `moose-kg:notSoftwareSubject`, exposed as the
frontmatter fields `kg.notApplicableTo` (variant labels → minted
`iirds:ProductVariant` nodes) and `kg.notSoftwareSubject` (enum → published
`iirdsSft:` subject IRIs), at **both document and section level** (via the
shared `emitIirdsTyping` helper). A contradiction — the same variant or subject
on both the positive and negative predicate of one node — is a **SHACL
`sh:disjoint` violation** (`moose-kg check` exit 1), the same core-SHACL construct
already used for `skos:related` vs `skos:broader`.

This followed directly from research (sourced to `iirds-consortium/models`,
schema.org, the OWL 2 Primer):

- **No standard term exists.** iiRDS has only affirmative `relates-to-*`/`has-*`
  relations — no antonym, no "excludes", no negative scope. schema.org has
  nothing usable (`schema:negativeNotes` is the con side of a pro/con review,
  not applicability). Option 3 is impossible.
- **`owl:NegativePropertyAssertion` is disqualified.** It is the theoretically
  correct idiom, but its only serialization is a **reified blank node** —
  violating the no-blank-nodes invariant. Giving it a deterministic IRI instead
  abandons the standard shape (so no interoperability upside), it is an OWL
  *axiom* rather than a data triple (awkward to read back and for SHACL), and
  SHACL cannot interpret its negation semantics without custom SPARQL. Option 2
  is out.
- Wakabayashi's `what_it_is_not` was therefore necessarily custom — there is
  nothing standard it could have mapped to.

**Trade-off, recorded:** minting a custom predicate is A-Box negation *without*
OWL formal semantics. An OWL reasoner will **not** infer a contradiction if some
triple also asserts the positive relation to the same target. But moose-kg does not
run an OWL reasoner — its consistency contract is SHACL, and the `sh:disjoint`
rule enforces exactly this contradiction. The OWL semantics we forgo are
semantics this stack never uses; the plain-triple form is the one that is
deterministic, blank-node-free, and directly validatable. Predicate names read
as instance-level applicability (`notApplicableTo*`), deliberately not
`disjointWith`-style, to avoid implying OWL T-Box property disjointness.

### Consumer contract (open-world)

The README states it explicitly: **absence of a positive edge means unknown, not
excluded.** A retrieval interlock must query the *negative* edge
(`moose-kg:notApplicableToVariant`) to exclude content — it must never infer
exclusion from a missing positive edge. This is what makes disciplined silence
expressible over an open-world graph.

### Consequences

- Good: negative scope is a plain, queryable, SHACL-validated edge — the
  interlock the research calls for, expressible without blank nodes or OWL.
- Good: contradictions fail `check` loudly instead of shipping an
  unresolvable graph.
- Good: reuses the Phase 3 section plumbing and the shared helper, so doc and
  section behave identically for free.
- Bad: the `moose-kg:` namespace grows by two properties (6 → 8). Justified: no
  external term exists, and each negates a distinct positive relation.
- Bad: `sh:disjoint` is per-focus-node only. A doc applying to X while one of
  its sections excludes X is *not* flagged — which is correct (legitimately
  different scopes), but means the shapes do not catch every conceivable
  human authoring mistake, only same-node contradictions.

### Confirmation

`test/unit/derive.test.ts` asserts each negative field emits the right predicate
and object at doc and section level, that `notApplicableTo` mints a
`ProductVariant`, and that an absent field emits nothing. `test/unit/shacl.test.ts`
validates a conforming negative graph and confirms a variant on both
`appliesTo` and `notApplicableTo` (and a subject on both `softwareSubject` and
`notSoftwareSubject`) is a `sh:disjoint` violation. `moose-kg validate` rejects an
out-of-enum `notSoftwareSubject`; `test/unit/schema-sync.test.ts` pins the enum
to `src/core/iirds.ts`; `test/integration/check.test.ts` keeps the clean corpus
at exit 0 against `moose-kg-0.4.ttl`. The determinism gates cover the new triples.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Mint minimal `moose-kg:` predicates

- Good: plain triples, no blank nodes, SHACL-validatable, consumer-legible,
  deterministic.
- Bad: custom vocabulary; no OWL reasoner semantics (enforced by SHACL
  instead).

### `owl:NegativePropertyAssertion`

- Good: the formally correct RDF idiom; a reasoner would infer contradictions.
- Bad: mandates a blank node (invariant violation); an axiom not a data triple;
  SHACL cannot validate its semantics; weak consumer/tooling support.

### Reuse a standard term

- Good: zero namespace growth, maximal interoperability.
- Bad: no such term exists in iiRDS or schema.org — not an available option.

### Documentation-only guidance

- Good: emits nothing new.
- Bad: leaves the interlock inexpressible in the graph, defeating the phase's
  purpose.
