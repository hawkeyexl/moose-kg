# Provenance defaults on: a tri-state `provenance.git`, and a build warnings channel

## Context and Problem Statement

ADR 01009 makes hermetic features default to on. Two opt-ins predate it:
`provenance.git` and `provenance.qualified`, both `false`. Flipping them is the
first behavior change of the roadmap, and the naive flip does not work.

Three obstacles, all confirmed against the code:

- **`provenance.git` fails hard when git is unavailable.** `collectGitHistory`
  throws `MooseKgError` (exit 2) when the cwd is not a git repo, has no commits,
  or git is not on PATH. Defaulting it on would turn every non-git corpus from
  a working build into an operational error — precisely the "on by default must
  not mean broken by default" case ADR 01009 forbids.
- **There is no warning channel.** moose-kg command cores return report objects and
  `cli.ts` renders them; the only diagnostic path is `fail()`'s `console.error`
  for a thrown error. Degrading "with a warning" has nothing to warn through.
- **Git provenance destabilizes the golden.** The build activity's
  `prov:endedAtTime` comes from the **HEAD committer date**. Building the
  regression corpus with git on emits
  `prov:endedAtTime "2026-07-22T14:40:31-07:00"^^xsd:dateTime`, which changes on
  every commit to this repo. The golden normalizes only `moose-kg:version`, so the
  corpus golden would fail on literally every commit.

`provenance.qualified` has none of these problems: it derives from data already
in the graph and emits only stable nodes (`prov:Attribution`,
`prov:Association`, `prov:hadRole`, and the qualified* properties).

## Decision Drivers

- ADR 01009's policy and its degradation rule.
- The golden is the determinism gate; it must stay stable across commits, and a
  gate that fails for reasons unrelated to derivation is worse than no gate.
- Some users genuinely require git provenance (reproducible attribution in CI);
  silently continuing without it would be its own failure.
- Config should be legible: a reader of `moose.config.yaml` should be able to
  tell what will happen without knowing which values were defaulted.
- Minimal new surface; warnings must stay testable without capturing console
  output.

## Considered Options

For `provenance.git`:

1. **Tri-state `"auto" | true | false`, default `"auto"`.** `auto` attempts git
   and degrades with a warning; `true` requires it and errors when unavailable;
   `false` skips the subprocess entirely.
2. **Boolean, default `true`, always degrade.** Simple, but removes any way to
   require git provenance.
3. **Boolean, default `true`, distinguishing explicit `true` from an inherited
   default** (ADR 01009's leading candidate) — explicit errors, inherited warns.
4. **Do not flip**; leave git provenance opt-in.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option 1, plus two supporting decisions.

**`provenance.git` becomes tri-state, defaulting to `"auto"`.** This implements
ADR 01009's principle — enabled wherever it can run, an explicit request that
cannot be honored is an operational error — while keeping the behavior visible
in the config file rather than dependent on invisible provenance of a value.
Option 3 was rejected for exactly that reason: the same literal `true` would
mean "error" or "warn" depending on whether the user typed it, which is
difficult to document, difficult to test, and surprising to read.

**`provenance.qualified` flips to `true` outright.** No external dependency, no
degradation path needed, stable output.

**Builds gain a warnings channel.** `BuildResult` grows `warnings: string[]`;
`runBuild` collects them and `cli.ts` renders each to **stderr**, leaving stdout
clean for the build summary. Warnings never change the exit code — exit 1 is
reserved for findings, and a degraded-but-successful build is not a finding.
This preserves the existing seam (cores return data, the CLI renders) and keeps
the behavior assertable in tests without intercepting console output.

**The regression corpus pins `provenance.git: false`.** The golden's job is to
catch derivation regressions deterministically, not to capture the repository's
commit state; letting HEAD's committer date into it would convert the
determinism gate into a test that fails on every commit. Git-derived output
stays covered by the dedicated integration tests that build temporary
repositories with `provenance.git: true`.

### Consequences

- Good: the opinionated default arrives without breaking non-git corpora, and
  users who need enforcement have an explicit, documented way to ask for it.
- Good: moose-kg gains a general diagnostic path it did not have; later phases
  (coverage, iiRDS derivation, exports) can warn instead of failing or staying
  silent.
- Good: `moose-kg build` in a git repo now emits richer provenance with no
  configuration — the point of the policy.
- Bad: the corpus golden no longer exercises the *default* value of
  `provenance.git`. Mitigated by a config unit test pinning the default and by
  the existing git integration tests; noted here so a future reader does not
  mistake the fixture's `false` for the shipped default.
- Bad: every default build now spawns `git log` once. Cheap for documentation
  corpora, and skipped entirely under `false`.
- Bad: builds in a git repo become sensitive to clone depth. CI checks out with
  `fetch-depth: 0`, so CI is unaffected; shallow clones still yield partial
  history silently, which is pre-existing behavior documented in the README.
- Neutral: CLAUDE.md's determinism invariant describes git dates as living
  "behind an opt-in flag". That clause is amended here to state the
  source-of-truth rule — frontmatter first, then git committer dates, never the
  wall clock — which is what the invariant actually protects.

### Confirmation

`test/unit/config.test.ts`: defaults are `git: "auto"` and `qualified: true`;
`true`/`false`/`"auto"` all parse; an unknown string (e.g. `"maybe"`) is
rejected by Ajv. `test/integration/build.test.ts`: a temp directory that is not
a git repo builds successfully under the default, exits 0, and emits a warning
naming the reason on stderr while stdout keeps the summary; the same directory
with explicit `provenance.git: true` still exits 2; `false` emits no warning and
no git triples. The existing temp-repo git tests continue to pass unchanged, and
the corpus golden — regenerated once for the qualified-provenance nodes — stays
byte-identical across rebuilds.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Tri-state `"auto" | true | false`

- Good: each state is meaningful and legible in the config file.
- Good: satisfies both the opinionated default and the enforcement need.
- Bad: a non-boolean value in a boolean-looking field; schema and type become
  `boolean | "auto"`.

### Boolean, default true, always degrade

- Good: simplest schema and simplest explanation.
- Bad: no way to require git provenance; a CI pipeline depending on it would
  silently produce attribution-free graphs after an infrastructure change.

### Boolean, default true, explicit vs inherited

- Good: no schema change.
- Bad: identical config values behave differently based on whether they were
  written down — invisible in the file, awkward to document, and it makes
  `parseConfig` carry provenance-of-values state it otherwise does not need.

### Do not flip

- Good: no golden churn, no new surface.
- Bad: contradicts ADR 01009 immediately after adopting it, and leaves the
  richest provenance behind a flag most users never find.
