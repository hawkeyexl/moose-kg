/**
 * Metadata coverage fields (ADR 01011). Coverage answers the ADR 01008
 * question — what can a graph-side consumer see — by counting `dockg:Document`
 * nodes that carry each predicate. The list is fixed and deliberate: a
 * predicate absent from every document still shows as 0%, which a dynamic
 * census could not surface. It is shared between the config parser (which
 * expands a uniform threshold across every field) and `dockg stats` (which
 * reports and gates), and pinned by test/unit/schema-sync.ts against the
 * config schema so it cannot silently drift.
