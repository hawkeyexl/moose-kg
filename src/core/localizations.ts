 * The localization manifest (ADR 01038) — `kg/localizations.json`, the index of

 *
 * Retrieval artifacts fan out per language: one `search.<lang>.json` and one
 * `vectors.<lang>.bin` each, because a single flat index over every locale
 * ranks across the boundary it exists to respect, and because one embedding
 * model cannot serve every language. The manifest is what makes that navigable
 * — a browser fetches this one small file, learns which localizations exist and
 * what each costs, and downloads only the pair it needs.
 *
 * Written by `dockg export --format search`; `dockg embed` fills in the
 * `vectors` block as it produces each sidecar, so a manifest entry without one
 * means exactly "this language has no vectors yet".
 *
 * No `node:` imports: the CLI writes it and the browser runtime reads it.
