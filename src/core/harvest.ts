/**
 * Near-miss detection for the page-level keys the harvest rule reads
 * (ADR 01024, ADR 01028).
 *
 * Five page-level keys are graph inputs — `type`, `concepts`, `applies-to`,
 * `not-applicable-to`, `supersedes` — and unlike the `kg` block, nothing
 * validates them. The `kg` block is `additionalProperties: false`, so a typo
 * inside it is a hard schema error; the same typo at the page level derives
 * silently nothing, because a page may legitimately carry any other key it
 * likes (a site generator's, a linter's, an author's).
 *
 * A schema is therefore the wrong instrument: rejecting unknown page keys would
 * reject every page. What is wrong with `applies_to` is not that dockg does not
 * know it — it is that it is one character from a key dockg *does* know, on a
 * page that declares nothing else of the kind. That is what this detects, and
 * it is the whole scope: dockg does not implement the vocabularies these keys
 * belong to and must not start claiming their facts (ADR 01024).
 *
 * Warnings only. A near miss is a suspicion, not a finding, and a suspicion
 * must never fail a build.
