/**
 * Vector search (ADR 01020) — semantic entry, and a standalone capability.
 *
 * `search()` is usable on its own: give it a query vector and it ranks nodes by
 * meaning, with no lexical index and no graph involved. `findEntry` composes it
 * with the lexical leg, but does not own it.
 *
 * Hand-written rather than taken from a library, on evidence: the dedicated
 * browser vector libraries are 3 years stale, no maintained micro-package does
 * cosine top-k over typed arrays (the popular one throws on `Float32Array`), and
 * the engines that do exist run this same brute-force loop internally. See ADR
 * 01020 for the full survey.
 *
 * Vectors are L2-normalized at build time, so cosine similarity **is** the dot
 * product — no norms, no division, at query time. The loop is indexed rather
 * than `.reduce()`, which measures ~13× slower on typed arrays.
 *
 * Platform-neutral: no `node:` imports, no dependencies.
