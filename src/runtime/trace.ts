/**
 * Query trace — the explainability contract (ADR 01018). Every runtime stage

 * provenance is part of the contract exactly as PROV provenance is part of the
 * build. The trace answers "how and why did this result come back": which nodes
 * were seeded, every hop walked, every node scope excluded (and by which rule),
 * and every content resolution attempted.
 *
 * Events are appended in traversal order, which is itself deterministic, so the
 * trace is byte-stable for a given graph + query.
