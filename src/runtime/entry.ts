/**
 * Entry-point finding (ADR 01019, extended by ADR 01020) — the stage that turns

 *
 * Two rankings now: lexical (BM25 over the search artifact) and, when the host
 * supplies an embedder, vector (cosine over the sidecar). `rrfMerge` fuses them.
 *
 * **Each leg is returned separately as well as fused.** A caller rendering a
 * search UI wants to show "text matches" and "semantic matches" as distinct
 * things, and either leg is usable on its own — `lexical.search` and
 * `vectors.search` are public and independent of this function.
 *
 * Every candidate is appended to the trace, so "why did retrieval start here?"
 * is answerable alongside "why did it walk there?" (ADR 01018 invariant 2).
 *
 * Platform-neutral: no `node:` imports.
