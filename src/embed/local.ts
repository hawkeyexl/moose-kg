/**
 * The local embedder ([ADR 01020](../../adrs/01020-local-embeddings.md), corrected
 * by [ADR 01021](../../adrs/01021-embedder-cross-platform-reality.md)).
 *
 * Node and the browser **do not** run the same implementation, and cannot be made
 * to. transformers.js v4 takes disjoint `device` vocabularies per platform — Node
 * accepts `dml | webgpu | cpu`, the browser accepts `webgpu | wasm` — so no single
 * value selects one backend everywhere. An earlier version of this file forced
 * `device: "wasm"`, which threw on every real Node run; see ADR 01021 for the
 * measurements.
 *
 * What that costs, measured on granite q8: Node native vs browser WASM agree to
 * cosine 0.999914 (max component diff 2.2e-3). dockg's guarantee is therefore
 * **ranking agreement**, gated by `test/real/cross-platform.mjs`, not float
 * equality.
 *
 * Three disciplines are real and pinned here:
 *
 *   1. `numThreads = 1` — binds on the WASM side, where the default follows
 *      `hardwareConcurrency` and would vary reduction splits per machine. Inert
 *      on the Node side, whose env object does not carry it.
 *   2. `dtype: "q8"` — int8 GEMM accumulates in int32, and integer addition is
 *      associative.
 *   3. One text per call — a batched vector depends on what it was batched with,
 *      so adding a document would perturb its neighbours.
 *
 * `device` is deliberately **not** passed: transformers.js then picks its platform
 * default, which in Node is bit-identical to an explicit `cpu` (measured) and in
 * the browser is WASM. A caller wanting `webgpu` can pass it.
 *
 * `@huggingface/transformers` is an **optional peer dependency**, imported
 * dynamically: it hard-depends on both ONNX runtimes plus native `sharp`, and
 * most dockg users never enable embeddings. Behind this subpath, a consumer who
 * never imports `dockg/embed` never resolves it.
